Wind and warmth sensations proved to be
able to enhance users' state of presence in Virtual
Reality applications. Still, only few projects deal with
their detailed effect on the user and general ways of
implementing such stimuli. This work tries to fill this
gap: After analyzing requirements for hardware and
software concerning wind and warmth simulations, a
hardware and also a software setup for the application in a
CAVE environment is proposed. The setup is evaluated
with regard to technical details and requirements, but
also - in the form of a pilot study - in view of user
experience and presence. Our setup proved to comply with
the requirements and leads to satisfactory results.
To our knowledge, the low cost simulation system
(approx. 2200 Euro) presented here is one of the most
extensive, most flexible and best evaluated systems for
creating wind and warmth stimuli in CAVE-based VR
applications.                                     </p>

      </div>
      <p>Enhancing presence is one of the most important topics
  in Virtual Reality research. Recent work shows that a high
  level of presence can be achieved, for example by a
  reasonable combination of feedback modalities [<span class="citation">
            <a class="xref" href="#XVisualAuditoryHaptic" title="FW13" shape="rect">FW13</a>
         </span>].
  Due to technical advancement, virtual worlds have already
  become more and more immersive. In this area, especially
  concerning rendering techniques and spatial sound,
  many advances have been made. But how can further
  natural sensations, e.g. airflow during navigation
  tasks, heat of a fire in a rescue scenario [<span class="citation">
            <a class="xref" href="#XVRARNachfrage" title="MKB13" shape="rect">MKB13</a>
         </span>]
  or simply the warmth inside a simulated desert be
  made perceivable in virtual environments? A common
                                                                                            

                                                                                            
type of VR applications consists of navigation tasks
which - in reality - include stimuli like airflow or
changes in temperature. Hence we suppose that an
extension of VR setups with wind and warmth will
improve users' state of presence. The hypothesis of
improved presence through multisensory stimuli is
supported by empirical work that shows the ability of
these modalities to do so (e.g. [<span class="citation">

sense for humans (rods and cones inside the human

      <p>Only little work has been published in this field. There
is no standardized hardware nor well grounded concepts
for creating wind and warmth sensations and embedding
them in VR environments. Furthermore, experimental
results concerning the perception of wind and warmth
sensations in VR setups are rare.
This paper is an extension of the work first presented in

summarized and extended by a detailed hardware and

  the level of presence a user perceives in a VR environment.
  Many systems have been developed, adding single

  enrichments (e.g. [<span class="citation">

  including olfactory stimuli can be found, either using
  global displays, which fill a whole room with odor, or
  presenting scents via a wearable device. The main
  problem using global approaches is the neutralization of
  the submitted smell. One system minimizing this problem
  is introduced by Yanagida et al.  [<span class="citation">

  drawback of being restrictive and are often regarded as
  being too intrusive. Concerning wind and warmth
  simulations, some approaches have been presented which
  will be described in the following.</p>
      <div class="section" lang="en">
         <div class="titlepage">

<a id="x1-60002.1" shape="rect"></a>Wind Simulation</h3>
         </div>
         <p>One example for the integration of
wind is the VR-Scooter described by Deligiannidis and
Jacob [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#XvrScooter" title="DJ06" shape="rect">DJ06</a>
            </span>]. A real scooter is used for navigation inside
the VR and generates tactile feedback using vibrotactile
actuators. In addition, a fan provides wind in front of the
user. The authors detected that perceived wind improves
both, task performance and subjective user experience.
The main disadvantage of their system is the inability to
provide directional wind. Thus the system is only useful in
a rather narrow scope.</p>
         <p>Moon and Kim introduced a setup which consists of 20
fans arranged in three horizontal levels around the
user [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xmoonkim" title="MK04" shape="rect">MK04</a>
            </span>]. A study showed that users cannot
distinguish between winds which come from neighboring
fans, if the angle in between is less than 45 degrees.
The system presented by Moon and Kim was able to
significantly enhance presence due to the application of
wind feedback. However, it was unable to compute
the wind influence in realtime: The authors used an
editor to design the wind field manually for each scene
beforehand.</p>
         <p>In 2013, Verlinden et al. presented a sail simulator
which was extended by a wind simulation to increase
presence [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xverlinden2013enhancement" title="VMV13" shape="rect">VMV13</a>
            </span>]. Eight fans are mounted at a height of
two meters on top of the floor. All fans are arranged in a
circle with a diameter of four meters. The user is sitting
inside a simulator having the outward appearance
of a real boat. Graphics are projected on a screen in
front of the user. The system was evaluated with 10
test subjects. The results showed an improvement of
immersion when using the wind feedback. Furthermore
the participants reported that the wind simulation had
helped them to orient. On the other hand, most of them
perceived the wind sensations as being too weak. Also, the
simulation suffered from the sound created by the
fans.</p>
         <p>Another approach is presented by Kulkarni et al.
who used the vortices of an airflow on the
projection wall to adapt the direction of a presented wind
up to an accuracy of 1-2 ° degrees [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xkulkarni2012design" title="KMD12?" shape="rect">KMD12</a>
</span>]. However,
the system can only be used with a certain display
arrangement and is thus not usable for a CAVE
environment. Also wind angles are only possible to be
perceived in the interval [-30 °, 30 °]. Furthermore
the wind cannot be created in realtime. A delay of 2 to 25 seconds appears when creating certain wind
directions.</p>
         <p>In addition to the above mentioned stationary systems,
  solutions directly mounted on the user's head are presented
  e.g. by Lehmann et al. [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xlehmann" title="LGWS09" shape="rect">LGWS09</a>
            </span>]. In their approach, a
  comparison of stationary global and local systems
  attached to the user was conducted: In a ski simulation,
  three conditions (no wind, stationary fans, head-mounted
  fans) were tested in a within-subjects study. The difference
  between stationary fans and head-mounted fans was not
  significant, but at least indicated a trend toward a higher
  level of presence when using the stationary wind sources.
  Further results showed a significantly higher level of
  presence when using wind compared to the no-wind
  condition.</p>

         </div>
         <p>Concerning the role of warmth in
  VR, there is only little research. Dionisio published an
  evaluation of possible hardware devices for temperature
  sensations in 1996, concluding that fans, infrared lamps
  and Peltier elements are the best option for VR-centered
  temperature simulations [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xdionisio" title="Dio97a" shape="rect">Dio97a</a>
            </span>]. An exemplary setup
  was introduced as a "virtual hell" [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#XVirtualHell" title="Dio97b" shape="rect">Dio97b</a>
            </span>], with each
  three fans and infrared lamps arranged around the user,
  as well as Peltier elements attached directly to the
  skin.</p>
         <p>To find thresholds concerning the perception of heat and
  cold, Gray et al. [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xgray" title="GSM82" shape="rect">GSM82</a>
            </span>] performed a study using Peltier
  elements as temperature actuator. Thresholds were found
  at changes of a temperature rise of 1.04 degrees Celsius
  and a drop of 0.15 degrees Celsius: Interestingly, a
  negative change in temperature is more easily perceived
  than a positive change.</p>

      <a id="x1-80003" shape="rect"></a>Requirements to Simulate Wind and Warmth in Virtual
  Reality</h2>
      </div>
      <p>As only few projects combine wind and warmth
  simulations with Virtual Reality setups, a detailed
  investigation of necessary requirements is mandatory.
                                                                                            

                                                                                            
These should be divided into hardware and software
requirements being independent from each other. This
assures a maximal extensibility and generality of the
concepts. Furthermore, the requirements should be
independent from a specific implementation and also from
the existing setup (e.g. HMD vs. Cave and standardized
VR framework vs. self-developed system) in which a
wind and warmth system is integrated.</p>
      <div class="section" lang="en">
         <div class="titlepage">
            <h3 class="title">
               <a id="d57e246" shape="rect"></a>3.1.&nbsp;
<a id="x1-90003.1" shape="rect"></a>Hardware Requirements</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A first requirement is that the
system must be save: Especially when using heat sources,
neither the user nor the existing system itself must be
endangered. Therefore, a direct contact between user and
heat sources must be avoided. For instance the position of
heat sources mounted on top of the user has to be adapted
according to the user's height. Temperature limits
have to be selected carefully, because many hardware
components, e.g. projectors or the tracking system, are
heat-sensitive. Thus temperature sensors must be used to
monitor the overall heat created.</p>
         <p>Further, the system must be capable of real-time
interactivity. A low latency toward the user's actions
(e.g. switching on/off a virtual fan or closing the coverage
of a virtual chimney) is required to apply the simulation in
a realistic Virtual Reality.</p>
         <p>As the user is able to change translation and rotation
inside the virtual world, the simulation must adapt to the
transformation of a wind and warmth source continuously.
Otherwise, a gap between visual feedback and the
sensations perceived could appear and decrease the user's
sense of presence [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#XWitmer1998" title="WS98" shape="rect">WS98</a>
            </span>].</p>
         <p>If the above mentioned criteria are satisfied, it must
be ensured that the user's interaction possibilities
are not limited by new hardware: Some hardware
solutions (e.g. concerning eyetracking [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#XHuelsmann2011" title="HDP11" shape="rect">HDP11</a>
            </span>])
influence the user's behavior due to cables and hardware
attached directly to the user. Furthermore, the existing
hardware itself (e.g. projection or tracking) must not be
affected.</p>
         <p>The following listing summarizes the proposed
	hardware requirements arranged by priority:</p>
         <p>
	           <span class="bf"><b>HW1</b></span> Do  not  endanger  the  user  or  hardware  by  the

      <a id="x1-100003.2" shape="rect"></a>Software Requirements</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Additional to the hardware
  requirements, the software system must also satisfy
  certain constraints. First of all, real-time capability must
  be ensured: A direct reaction to the user's actions is
  necessary in a Virtual Reality simulation. Otherwise,
  the gap between visual information and wind and
  warmth sensations could lead to decreased presence.
  Altough, a realistic rendering is desirable, a physically
  modeled simulation for calculating the exact influences
  of wind and warmth sources would need too much
  computational power. Also, it is doubtable whether such a
  realistic simulation is necessary (e.g. for rendering light
  and sound, simplified models like the Phong lighting
  model are applied successfully). Therefore, a balance
  between realism and computational costs has to be
  found.</p>
         <p>Inside the simulation, the user should be able to move
  freely with six degrees of freedom. Therefore, the user
  must be represented inside the simulation and the software
  has to be able to adapt the sensation's direction and
  position according to the user's actions. Furthermore,
  virtual occlusions must be considered: If a user is placed
  inside a virtual building or behind a wall, sensing the same
  sensations as outside would be unnatural and thus disrupt
  perceived presence inside the scene. The system must
  react to a changed distance between wind/warmth source
  and the user. Hence, an appropriate attenuation function
  has to be found.</p>
         <p>Wind and warmth sensations appear in different situations
  and are created by different causations: airstream
  created by the user's movement, storm belonging to the
  simulation of a landscape, virtual fans, a fire inside a
  rescue scenario et cetera. Therefore, an abstract model

warmth.</p>
         <p>When using a combination of wind and warmth
sources, crossmodal influences could appear between
wind and warmth (as using wind also influences the

  VR</h2>
      </div>
      <p>A physically modeled simulation of wind and warmth
  would be too complex to compute in real-time and with
  low latency. The model presented here describes an
  approximation for the application in a VR context. For
  managing the VR scene, a scene graph is used. Inside the
  scene graph, each object (e.g. a 3D model) and all further
  entities (e.g. scripts controlling the application) are
  represented as so-called nodes. Hence, each wind and
  warmth source is also represented as a single node.
  The VR framework sends these nodes and further
  relevant parts of the scene to a dedicated <span class="it">sensation
  engine</span>. This engine calculates the influence of the
  wind and warmth nodes on the scene and activates
  the hardware components. Figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-110011" target="_top" shape="rect">1</a>  illustrates this
  process.</p>

      <p>Our concept to represent wind and warmth nodes is
inspired by the Phong lighting model and also by the
representation of sound objects inside Virtual Reality
applications first presented by Fröhlich and Wachsmuth
[<span class="citation">
            <a class="xref" href="#XAcousticallyEnriched" title="FW12" shape="rect">FW12</a>
         </span>]. They present three kinds of sound: ambient
sound, static sound and event sound. Ambient sound can
be perceived in large areas inside a scene and does not
have a position. It is played with the same intensity on all
available speakers. Only one ambient sound can be
played at the same time. Static sounds are emitted
directly by an object to which they are attached. A
static sound's transformation is changed automatically
when the transformation of the corresponding object is
changed. The output of the individual speakers is
adapted to intensity and direction of the sound and to
the relative user position and rotation. Event sounds
are related to the static sounds, but only triggered
due to a certain event: This could be a ball hitting a
surface e.g. water, stone or a virtual door shut by a
user.</p>
      <p>To simulate different types of sensations (e.g. fans, fire
et cetera), the following wind and warmth node types
were developed according to the above mentioned
concept:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         <ul type="disc">
            <li>
               <p>

  Directional wind / directional warmth
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>

  Spot wind
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>

  Point warmth
</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
The naming is inspired by the concept of representing light
sources in the X3D standard. The instances of the
nodetypes <span class="tt">directional wind / directional
warmth</span> have an infinite distance towards the user and are
analogous to the ambient sound nodes. Accordingly, they
are perceivable inside the whole scene from the same
direction (except from virtual occlusions). Examples for
the usage of these nodetypes could be weather influences
like storms or the effect of the sun. Nodes of the type
<span class="tt">spot wind</span> have a fixed position and are bound to
an object (e.g. to a virtual fan). These wind sources
only influence the area which lies in a directed cone
located in the wind source. The cone is defined by a
given angle and the intensity of the wind source (cf.     figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-110022" target="_top" shape="rect">2</a>). The nodetype <span class="tt">point warmth</span> is similar
  to the <span class="tt">spot wind</span>: It is bound to a certain object
  (e.g. a virtual chimney), but it has no direction. The
  warmth is emitted toward all directions and therefore
  the node is represented by a sphere. The radius of
  the sphere is defined by the node's intensity. Both
  nodetypes can be seen as analogous to static and event
  sound.</p>

         <p>The stimuli are presented inside a three-sided
(floor, front, left) CAVE environment. Six projectors use
polarized light for enabling stereoscopic vision. User
tracking is performed by a marker-based DTrack2 system
by ART, using 10 cameras. The cameras use infrared light
reflections for marker tracking. Spatial sound is enabled
by a 8.1 sound system: Eight active speakers are arranged
in a cube around the CAVE, a subwoofer system is embedded in
the CAVE floor. An air conditioner assures a constant
temperature of about 20 degrees Celsius. It does not
produce any wind which could be perceived inside the
CAVE.</p>
         <p>To calculate the distributed graphical output, the
InstantReality framework by the Fraunhofer IGD is
applied. It is augmented by knowledge-based approaches
for managing and representing sound, haptics et cetera as

         <p>In the following, the decision to use large scale fans attached
  to the CAVE hardware is explained. Arguments are
  followed by the related hardware requirements in
  parentheses. An accurate simulation of the wind direction
  as presented in [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xkulkarni2012design" title="KMD12" shape="rect">KMD12</a>
            </span>] is not possible, because of the
  construction of the CAVE. Furthermore, their solution is
  not real-time capable (HW2). While CPU fans are a cheap
  solution and easy to control, they have to be attached
  directly to the user to provide a sufficient wind simulation.
  Hardware attached to the user could lead to a reduced
  usability, because the user feels limited by the hardware
  and may not act naturally anymore (HW4). The wind
  created by an air conditioner is difficult to control
  concerning the intensity, but also with regard to the wind
  direction (HW3). Wind machines which could be
  able to simulate a very realistic sensation of wind are
  too noisy und would thus disrupt the user's presence
  (HW4). Thus the only solution fully satisfying the
  constraints is attaching large scale fans directly to the
  CAVE: Eight fans by ADDA are attached in a circle
  above the projection walls with an angle of 45 degrees
  in between. The frontal fans could not be placed as
  optimal as the other fans for technical reasons: The
  back-projection mirror for the floor needs too much free
  space.</p>
         <p>Finally, due to the angle approximating the 45 degrees
  proposed by Moon et al. [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xmoonkim" title="MK04" shape="rect">MK04</a>
            </span>], the wind direction can
  be simulated continuously on the horizontal plane (HW3).
  A direct contact between fans and user or other parts
                                                                                            

                                                                                            
of the hardware is prevented by their positioning.
Therefore, endangering user or hardware can be excluded
(HW1). Each fan has a diameter of 25.4 cm and a wind
performance of 12.735 m³ / min. All fans are operated at
115 instead of 230 Volt to reduce noise (HW4): From a
distance of one meter, a noise volume of 55.6 dB/A can
be measured. Figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-160013" target="_top" shape="rect">3</a>  shows a single fan and the
mounting of the hardware inside the CAVE. Figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-160024" target="_top" shape="rect">4</a>

real-time via MultiDimMKIII Dimmerpacks by ShowTec

In the following, the decision to use infrared lamps is
explained similar to the argumentation concerning the
wind hardware. A radiant heater would - because of the
usage of gas fuel - be too dangerous for the usage in the
VR lab (HW1). The air conditioner was excluded because
of its inertness, not being capable of real-time heating and
because it requires a complex control mechanism without
standardized interfaces (HW2). For most radiant heaters,
the temperature cannot be set continuously (HW3).
Furthermore, they need a time range of about one minute
to reach an adequate temperature and thus are not
real-time capable (HW2). In related projects, Peltier
elements are used [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xdionisio" title="Dio97a" shape="rect">Dio97a</a>
            </span>]. However, they must be
attached directly to the user. This would raise the
risk to reduce the system's usability and thus also the
perceivable presence (HW4). Electric blankets or
warming suits were also excluded, because like the
Peltier elements, they could lead to a reduced usability
(HW4).</p>
         <p>Finally, only infrared lamps appear to be usable for
  warmth simulations inside a CAVE: They endanger (if the
  overall temperature is controlled by sensors) neither
  user nor hardware (HW1) and react instantly (HW2).
  Nevertheless, a system consisting of one infrared lamp
  would be unable to simulate spatial warmth (HW3).
  Furthermore, the warmth intensity created by a single
  lamp using standard E27 sockets is not sufficient.
  Therefore, a system consisting of six infrared lamps
  placed on top of the CAVE is selected. Each lamp
  has a power of 250 Watt and is able to heat the area
  directly around the lamp to up to 100 degrees Celsius.
  All lamps are placed on top of the CAVE to prevent
  a distraction from the hardware setup (HW4) and
  because the user's head is, according to [<span class="citation">
               <a class="xref" href="#Xkojima2009" title="KHK09" shape="rect">KHK09</a>
            </span>], one of
  the most sensitive areas for warmth stimuli (most
  other parts of the body are covered with clothes).
  The lamps distance toward the user can be varied
  according to the user's height (HW1). To prevent the
  system from getting too hot, two <span class="it">M-ware®</span> temperature
  sensors are attached to the CAVE (HW1). Unfortunately
  the infrared lamps emit some visible light, which
  distorts the projection. Therefore heat-proof color
  foils are attached in front of the lamps; sideward,
  they are surrounded by metal (HW4). If a lamp is
  directed toward a tracking camera, a part of its field
  of view is distorted. These areas are automatically
  determined and excluded from tracking. Thus the
  appearance of false positives when switching on the
  lamps is prohibited. A part of the technical evaluation
  presented in Section  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-200006.1.1" target="_top" shape="rect">6.1.1</a>  shows that tracking is not
  affected by the usage of the lamps (HW4). Like the fans,
  the infrared lamps are also controlled in real-time by
  MultiDimMKIII Dimmerpacks (HW2). Figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-160013" target="_top" shape="rect">3</a>  shows
  a single infrared lamp with the heat-proof color foil, the metal surrounding and the mounting inside the
  CAVE.</p>

         </div>
         <p>The software implementation
consists of three main components: A wrapper for the
above mentioned wind and warmth sources represented in
the Virtual Reality framework (InstantReality), the
sensation engine and a library loaded to establish the
connection between VR framework and sensation engine.
The library loaded by the VR framework sends all
necessary changes inside the scene to the sensation
engine. This is performed in fixed intervals. Afterwards,
the engine calculates the activation of the wind and
warmth hardware and propagates changes throughout the
VR framework. Figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-170015" target="_top" shape="rect">5</a>  describes the information flow
between the components of the wind and warmth
framework.</p>

The implementation of the sensation sources inside the
VR framework consists of one wrapper node for each
wind and warmth nodetype: directional wind, directional
warmth, spot wind and point warmth. Furthermore,
physical objects which are able to react to changes of the
wind intensity (e.g. clouds, falling leaves, flags) are
enriched via a connection to the sensation engine:
The engine informs them about the airflow at their
current position. The detection of virtual occlusions is
implemented inside the graphics framework: Transfering
all necessary geometries for occlusion checks to the
sensation engine, would create unnecessary load for the
network connection. For each object influenceable by
wind effects and for the user himself, occlusions are
checked as described in Algorithm  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-170031" target="_top" shape="rect">1</a>.</p>

         <p>The library establishing the link between VR framework
and sensation engine acts as a parser for the node format
used in the VR framework. The nodes are serialized for
the sensation engine and the information provided
by the engine is transformed into valid nodetypes
of the corresponding VR framework. This approach
allows the usage of different VR/Graphics frameworks,
e.g. InstantReality, Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender et
cetera. Inside the sensation engine, the following steps are
executed:</p>

  lamps, a tool measuring the size of the tracking volume
  has been developed and works as follows:</p>

First, the coverage of the original setup (without the use of
  infrared lamps) is determined. Afterwards, all infrared
  lamps are switched on with full power. Some of the
  tracking cameras are directly spotted by the lamps. This
  leads to some areas in the lens coverage of single cameras
  which are not usable for tracking. These areas are
  automatically excluded in a calibration pass. Figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-200076" target="_top" shape="rect">6</a> 
  visualizes the areas excluded for single cameras. The
  target is then again moved through the CAVE. Afterwards,
  the results with and without infrared lamps can be
  compared.</p>

by the lamps might be too large which would make it
impossible to exclude it from tracking without reducing

            </div>
            <p>The sensation simulator runs at about
30 fps. To determine the time, the wind and warmth
actuators need to influence the area at the center of the
CAVE, the following experiment was conducted: The
hardware components are activated as if a virtual wind or
warmth source would be presented toward a user. In the
center of the CAVE, a device to measure the stimulus is
placed inside the volume the user's head normally fills.
Afterwards, the wind node is activated and the time after
the measurement device detects a change in wind speed is
taken. A similar experiment was conducted to measure the
reaction time of the lamps. After determining the time, the
lamps and fans need to be switched on and make their
sensations perceivable inside the CAVE. The time to
deactivate the stimuli is measured using a similar
procedure.</p>
            <p>To minimize the delay the measurement device
for wind speed induces, it was replaced by a simple
pendulum trackable by the ART tracking system. The time
the pendulum needed to be affected by the wind was
measured. For measuring the warmth, a VOLTCRAFT
IR 280 measurement device was used (latency &lt; 0.5 s).</p>
            <p>Warmth needed 1.5 seconds to influence the measured
area after the lamps were switched on and 1.8 seconds to
create a measurable temperature difference after switching
the lamps off. The values for wind were 2.1 seconds for
switching on and 1.1 seconds for switching off. The
hardware itself reacts instantly, the measured values
represent the time which the air at the center of the CAVE
needs to be moved by the fans or to be heated by the
lamps.</p>
            <p>In a second step, the number of possible wind and
  warmth sources in a typical VR scene was tested: A
  number of 150 to 200 wind or warmth sources can be used
  simultaneously without reducing the framerate. As for
  typical VR scenes, not more than 10 or 20 different stimuli
  sources are used, the wind and warmth system does not
  affect the overall simulation performance.</p>

  and degrees Celsius were used to describe the warmth
  intensity. A wind measurement device by ELV was
  used to determine the wind speed. As temperature
  sensor, the VOLTCRAFT IR 280 was used. Figure

            <p>The <span class="bf">warmth</span> distribution was investigated on three
planes with a vertical distance of 25 cm, 35 cm and 45 cm
toward the lamps. If all infrared lamps are switched off,
the room has a basic temperature of about 20 °C. This
temperature is normally assured by two air conditioners.
However, the lamps are able to heat the room temporarily,
because of the slow reaction time of the air conditioners.
After activating the simulation of a virtual warmth
source directly behind the front wall of the CAVE, the
highest temperature measured on the grid was 28.7 °C,
which is a possible temperature increase of 8.5 °C.
The lowest temperature measured on the grid was
22.6 °C. Figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-220028" target="_top" shape="rect">8</a>  shows the warmth distribution on the
grid for all three planes. The results indicate that a
high level of temperature increase is possible (7.1 °C more than the threshold determined by Gray et al. to
make warmth perceivable on the skin [<span class="citation">
                  <a class="xref" href="#Xgray" title="GSM82" shape="rect">GSM82</a>
               </span>]). The
temperature is distributed quite constantly inside the
whole CAVE area. Therefore it is assumed that the warmth
direction cannot be perceived by possible users in a solid
way.</p>

            <p>The <span class="bf">wind</span> distribution is measured on 5 planes with a
vertical distance of 45 cm, 55 cm, 65 cm, 75 cm and 85 cm toward the fans. Without activating any virtual
wind source, no wind flow can be measured inside
the whole area. After activating the simulation of a
virtual wind source directly behind the front wall, a
maximum wind speed of 19.7 m / s can be measured. It is
eye-catching that the wind intensity strongly depends on
the position and direction of the fans. For this evaluation a
frontal wind source was used, because this represents
the worst case concerning the wind distribution: The
frontal fans are not placed as equal as the other fans
inside the setup as explained in Section  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-90003.1" target="_top" shape="rect">3.1</a>. The
results (see Figure  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-220039" target="_top" shape="rect">9</a>) suggest that the best area to
perceive wind sources from arbitrary directions is
in the center of the CAVE. Although the influence
is quite moderate, the results for different vertical
distances are balanced and a wind speed of 2.3 m / s
on average (45 cm: 3.6 m / s, 55 cm: 4.4 m / s, 65 cm:
3.6 m / s, 75 and 85 cm: 0 m / s - too little wind to be
measurable) can be measured in the center of the CAVE.
Furthermore, an equal wind quality for most possible wind
directions is expected for this central position which is
also the most typical position of the user in many
applications.</p>

                  <p>

            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>To answer these questions, a small study with N = 9 subjects
was conducted. Their age ranged between 20 and 51 years
(M = 22.67, SD = 10.3). They were recruited through
postings in the university building and all of them were
native speakers of German. Most were students at
Bielefeld University, three were female. The design
comprises three steps with the same participants. First, a
set of given wind directions had to be estimated by the
participants. A Nintendo Wii remote was used to point at
the estimated wind direction. Second, the reaction times
were evaluated, and third the activation thresholds
were tested. To reduce hints on possible activations of
hardware components, participants were blindfolded
in each stage of the experiment in which wind was
used. Additionally, an artificial wind sound was faded
in - independently from the actual activation of the
hardware - to prevent participants from hearing the
fans.</p>

      <a id="x1-240006.2.1" shape="rect"></a>Setup</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Before starting the experiment, the participant
  was placed in the center of the CAVE. The Nintendo Wii
  remote equipped with a tracking target was placed in the
  dominant hand. At first, the accuracy for determining wind
  directions was tested. As pointing with the Wii remote
  could be error-prone and because not all possible
  participants could be expected to have the same pointing
  accuracy using this device, the accuracy was evaluated
  before the actual experiment as follows: A blue circle was
  projected directly on one of the CAVE screens without
  using the system's 3D mode. The participant used the Wii
  remote to point at the circle and pressed a button. This was
  repeated eight times and the pointing error with respect to
  x and z axis was saved. The positions of the circles were
  varied between participants using a 9x9 Latin square
  pattern.</p>
            <p>Directly before starting the actual experiment,
  the participant was blindfolded. Then the visual
  stimuli were replaced by wind stimuli. Again, the
  participant used the Wii remote to point toward the wind
  source. Then a button was pressed and the wind was
  deactivated. After a short period, a new wind source
  was presented. This was repeated for eight times.
  Now, the error with respect to the x and z axis was
  determined <a id="x1-24001f2" shape="rect"></a>
               <span class="footnoteReference">&nbsp;[<a id="d57e1003" href="#ftn.d57e1003" shape="rect">2</a>]</span>.
  The possible wind positions were varied by using a 9x9
  Latin square pattern. They were arranged all around the
  user to ensure a good coverage.</p>
            <p>The reaction times toward presented stimuli were
  tested during a second pass: The participant was still
  blindfolded and a virtual wind source directly in front of
  the participant was activated on full power. As soon as the
  participant perceived the stimulus, a button on the Wii
  remote had to be pressed. The stimulus was then presented
  for a few more seconds and finally switched off. As soon
  as the participant had perceived that the stimulus had
  stopped, the button had to be pressed again. Afterwards,
  the same procedure was executed using a warmth
  source.</p>
            <p>In a third step, hardware activation thresholds necessary
  to make a stimulus perceivable were determined: Fans
  were activated in five percent steps until the participant
  perceived the stimulus and pressed the button. This was
  repeated using the infrared lamps afterwards. Here,
  the lamps and fans were not switched off during the
  on phases, because the temperature threshold which
  is necessary to perceive a change in temperature, is
                                                                                            

                                                                                            
smaller if the temperature decreases [<span class="citation">
                  <a class="xref" href="#Xgray" title="GSM82" shape="rect">GSM82</a>
               </span>]. This
would have led to a falsification of the results: The
participants would have reacted to the switch off events
and not as it was desired toward the increase of the
temperature.</p>

            <p>Regarding the <span class="bf">reaction time</span>, typical users need to
react toward a wind stimulus, the time to perceive the
appearance of the stimulus is significantly longer (p &lt; 0.01) than the time for perceiving the disapperance
<em>(M<sup>+</sup> = 3.1 s, M<sup>-</sup> = 1.3 s,)</em>. Concerning warmth, there is
no significant difference <em>(M<sup>+</sup> = 2.5 s, M<sup>-</sup> = 2.0 s,)</em>.
Table  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-260024" target="_top" shape="rect">4</a>  summarizes these results. Altogether, the
reaction times suffice to simulate static and ambient
wind sources, but also event winds for e.g. a passing
train or the approaching toward a warm chimney in
realtime. Shorter events e.g. the airflow created by a door
which is closed, can be simulated in many cases by
precomputing the time, at which the wind stimulus should
start.</p>

         </div>
         <p>To gain a first hint on
the user experience, which can be reached using the
presented system, a pilot study with N = 23 participants (9
female, 14 male, <em>M<sup>age</sup> = 25</em> years, <em>SD<sup>age</sup> = 8.68</em>) was
conducted. The participants were mainly students
recruited in the university building. All of them were
randomly assigned to one of two between-subject
conditions: The control group (N=12) experiences certain
Virtual Reality scenes without wind and warmth stimuli,
the test group (N=11) perceives the scenes enriched with
wind and warmth.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The participant wearing 3D goggles and a
Nintendo Wii remote was placed inside the CAVE. An
information text was projected on the front wall and
described the participant's fictitious role in the following
experiment: "As a researcher on an expedition you will
move through certain different environments. During the
experiment, you have to solve small tasks".</p>
            <p>Subsequently, another text was presented. It contained a
short introduction to the following virtual world and
instructed the participant to closely investigate and
remember the environment. Now the first scene was
presented. To prevent overcharging the participant with
learning special navigation techniques, the participant was
moved automatically through the environment. The only
direct interaction with the scene consisted of virtual
buttons which were able to be activated by the participant
using the Wii remote. After moving through the scene, a questionnaire was filled out. This procedure was repeated
 with five different scenes. To prevent an influence on the
 results according to the order in which the scenes were
 presented, they were varied using a 5x5 Latin square
 pattern. Each scene contained wind and/or warmth stimuli.
 The following list presents the scenes used (cf. figure
 <a class="ulink" href="#x1-2800111" target="_top" shape="rect">11</a> ):</p>

     side. It can be opened by using a virtual button.
     As soon as the gate is opened, the participant is
     moved through a sparse desert-like environment.
     When the participant enters the desert, a warmth
     stimulus is presented.</p>

     placed on a scaffold over an ocean. The scaffold
     leads to an isle consisting of a volcano. At first -
     when being on the scaffold - a wind stimulus can
     be  perceived.  When  approaching  the  volcano's
     lava lake, the wind is occluded by a rock and a
     warmth stimulus is presented.</p>

     participant. From the right, a wind stimulus can
     be perceived. It results from a virtual fan, which
     is placed on a desk. The participant can control
     the fan's intensity by using virtual buttons on the
     desk.</p>

     chimney  is  presented.  First,  it  is  covered  by  a
     transparent pane. The participant can remove the
     pane by pressing a virtual button. This intensifies
     the presented warmth stimulus.</p>

     by  an  approaching  train  can  be  perceived.  The
     navigation  speed  is  increased  and  just  before
     the  train  arrives,  the  participant  is  stopped  and
     placed next to the tunnels wall. When passing the
     participant, the train produces wind.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The dependent variables were analyzed and measured
using five types of questionnaires: (1) One questionnaire
was used for surveying demographic information. (2) The
standardized Immersion Tendency Questionnaire (ITQ)
developed by Witmer and Singer [<span class="citation">
                  <a class="xref" href="#XWitmer1998" title="WS98" shape="rect">WS98</a>
               </span>] consists of 12
questions and measures the capability of individuals to
get immersed in everyday activities (e.g. reading,
watching movies). (3) The standardized Simulator
Sickness Questionnaire [<span class="citation">
                  <a class="xref" href="#XsimulatorSickness" title="KLBL93" shape="rect">KLBL93</a>
               </span>] measures simulator
sickness induced by the virtual environment. (4) A
modified version of the Slater, Usoh, Stead Questionnaire
(SUS) [<span class="citation">
                  <a class="xref" href="#Xsus" title="UCAS00" shape="rect">UCAS00</a>
               </span>] was applied to provide a measure for
determining the perceived presence during the experiment
(in the interval [0,9]). (5) A further questionnaire
adapted to the scenes determined the quality of the
stimuli's direction and intensity and includes further
open questions about the participants' experience.
The realism of the intensity was rated on a five point
scale in the interval [-2,+2], where zero is the optimal
value. Lower values stand for weak stimuli, higher
values for stimuli which are too intense. The direction
was also rated on a five point scale, in this case in
the interval [0,+4]. Here zero stands for the optimal
direction and higher values indicate a less realistic
perceived wind direction compared with the visual
stimuli.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Before entering the virtual environment,
  the participant had to fill in a consent form and the
  questionnaires 1, 2 and 3. Then, the participant was placed
  in the center of the CAVE and equipped with a Wii remote
  and tracked goggles. After explaining the procedure,
  the information text was presented on the projection
  walls. Next, each scene was presented and followed by
  questionnaire 4 and 5. After encountering all five scenes,
  the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire was answered again.
  Eventually, the participant was thanked for joining the
  experiment. This procedure needed approximately 30
  minutes.</p>

  broken down for the single scenes. The intensity is rated
  as realistic, but in some cases slightly too weak for both
  types of stimuli. There is no significant difference between
  wind and warmth. The results for the direction are similar,
  here are also no significant differences between wind and
  warmth.</p>

            <p>Looking closer at the scenes, it becomes noticeable that
in only one scene (Scene 3: Fan), the stimulus intensity is
rated as being too strong compared with the other scenes
(M = 0.273, SD = 1.0, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the
results concerning the wind direction indicate a trend to
weaker results in this scene than to all other scenes (M
= 1.545, SD = 1.2, p = 0.1). This finding could be
caused by a gap between visual and wind stimuli: The
participant perceived the wind before being able to
recognize the virtual fan. So there is no explanation for the
sudden appearance of the wind. Therefore, the overall
realism of the stimulus is rated worse, because the
visual stimulus is more important when perceiving the
scene.</p>
            <p>For Scene 4 (Chimney), slightly worse results concerning
the intensity (M = -1.182, SD=0.75, p = 0.618) were
reported. Two reasons seem possible: (1) The overall
intensity is too low compared with other scenes or (2) the
visual direction of the stimulus contrasts with the
perceived direction (visual direction: from the front,
position of the infrared lamps: on top of the user). Both
hypothesis can neither be verified nor falsified: The fire's
intensity is comparable with the stimulus intensities found
in the other scenes. Nevertheless, the distance toward the
virtual warmth source is slightly greater than the distance
implemented in the other scenes. For verifying the second
hypothesis, the results concerning the direction should
be worse for Scene 4 (Chimney). The mean values
are in fact slightly different, but these results are not
significant. Thats why further studies should evaluate a
necessary analogy between visual and wind/warmth
stimuli.</p>
            <p>Concerning the perceived presence, no significant
results were recognized as expected due to the small
number of participants. Nevertheless, a trend can be
observed for Scene 1 (Desert) and Scene 2 (Volcano): Here,
the results are slightly better when using wind and
warmth (<em>M<sup>desertWW</sup> = 4.9</em>, <em>M<sup>desertControl</sup> = 3.4</em>,
<em>p<sup>desert</sup> = 0.086</em>, <em>M<sup>volcanoWW</sup> = 6.5</em>, <em>M<sup>volcanoControl</sup> = 5.3</em>,

      </div>
      <p>This paper described a setup to create wind and warmth
simulations in a Virtual Reality environment. First,
general requirements to simulate wind and warmth
in the context of VR were developed and analyzed.
Further, possible hardware devices to produce the
stimuli were discussed and the best hardware for the
described CAVE environment was chosen. Afterwards, the
setup of the hardware was described with respect to the
requirements. A software model to represent the stimuli
inside the VR framework and for the communication
between VR framework and hardware was developed.
Furthermore, the system was evaluated with respect to
technical details, namely possible disturbances of
hardware, latency and real-time aspects, hardware
performance and quality of the framework to determine
direction and intensity of the stimuli. Finally, a pilot study
suggests a rise in user experience and also a trend
concerning a rise of perceivable presence which could be
realized by the system. The presented system is - to our
knowledge - one of the most extensive, most flexible and
best evaluated systems to create wind and warmth
stimuli in Virtual Reality applications designed for
CAVE environments. Furthermore, the low cost system
(approx. 2200 Euro) is not only applicable for the
described CAVE environment, but also for example
for HMD setups. Table  <a class="ulink" href="#x1-320017" target="_top" shape="rect">7</a>  summarizes the system's
properties.</p>

      <p>Although the system's capabilities are satisfactory and
the reported results are promising, there is a large potential
for possible further research. Two areas are in the center of
future tasks: Improvements of the system itself and more
detailed large-scale evaluations.</p>
      <p>Starting with system improvements, virtual occlusions
are handled quite rudimentarily: A stimulus is occluded
or it is not. But what about for example concerning
the difference between a fire which is occluded by a
thick concrete wall (e.g. a tunnel wall) and a fire
which is occluded simply by a pane of glass (e.g. a
window of a car)? To be able to simulate these situations,
materials must be equipped with a kind of wind/warmth
transparency factor alpha. To handle the occlusions itself,
algorithms well known from the area of computer graphics
(e.g. shadowing) could be used. At the moment, warmth
sources are only bound to one single sphere. Binding
them to more complex objects, e.g. arbitrary meshes
would make the design of complex scenes, e.g. a
warm pipeline or the warmth of a virtual large scale
fire.</p>
      <p>Concerning the user experience and especially the
achieved level of presence, the presented results are
quite promising. Nevertheless, a detailed study with
more participants and more detailed questionnaires is
necessary. Furthermore, measurement of heart rate and
skin conductance as applied by Slater et al. in [<span class="citation">
            <a class="xref" href="#XAnalysisOfPhysiologicalResponsesToASocialSituationInAnImmersiveVirtualEnvironment" title="SGE06" shape="rect">SGE06</a>
         </span>] is
desirable for quantifying the perceived presence and for
gaining significant results. Here, it is planned to analyze
how necessary a close correlation of wind/warmth stimuli
and the visual output is. How closely need wind and
warmth stimuli to be correlated with visual stimuli?
How does presence decrease in relation to increased
distance between wind and warmth and the correlated
visual output? Also, a determination of crossmodal
influences between wind and warmth stimuli presented
simultaneously would seem interesting. We believe that
further advancement in this direction will make wind and
temperature sensations as common in future Virtual
Reality as sound is today.</p>
